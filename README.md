# README Generator
## Description
The aim of this projects is to create a README generator which can be used for any GITHUB project to help generate the README file for it by only asking the contributor a few simple questions. Completing this project has helped me learn a lot about .md files such as how to better structure a README file or how to add internal links and connect it with the functions written in js which I initially thought was imposssible.

## Challenges
At the start of this project I highly underestimated the work needed.
My biggest challenge was making the license badges appear at the top of the README file based on the user choice; I tried out many different methods for this before it finally worked. After that was making the table of contents into internal links.
Overall I'm very glad the project met each of the requirements and is finally working.
